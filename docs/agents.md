Each agent takes `cwd`, `env`, `args`, a best-effort `model`, a
[pre-launch hook](#pre-launch-hook), and a [permission policy](#permission-requests). With
`host:` it runs on another machine, reached over ssh — see [Remote hosts](remote-hosts.md). Sessions
persist where the agent supports it; the commands an agent advertises are
reachable through its own `/<agent>` menu rather than registered globally (see
[Chat commands](chat-commands.md#agent-commands)). `doctor` verifies every configured harness.

## Pre-launch hook

`hooks.preLaunch` is a command the daemon runs, and waits for, before every start
of the agent's process: the first message of a conversation, `/new`, and a respawn
after an idle stop or a crash. Use it for whatever has to be in place first:

```yaml
agents:
  - id: boxed
    harness: custom
    command: docker
    args: [exec, -i, my-agent, my-agent, --acp]
    hooks:
      preLaunch: docker start my-agent >/dev/null
```

- It runs under `bash -lc`, in the conversation's working directory, with the
  agent's `env`. It works with every harness, not only `custom`.
- It runs once for every agent process. Each conversation has its own process, so the
  hook runs many times. Make it safe to run again.
- If it exits non-zero, or is still running after 60 seconds, the turn fails with
  the last of its output and the agent is not started. The next message tries again.
- `/stop` while it runs cancels it.
- Anything it leaves running in the background (`ssh -fN`, `cmd &`) keeps running.
  The daemon does not wait for it.
- The full output of the last 20 runs is kept in `~/.config/talkcode/hooks/<agent-id>/`.
- `${VAR}` is expanded when the config loads, like every other string. Write `$VAR`
  for the shell to expand when the hook runs.

The hook cannot be changed from chat (`/setting`). Doing that would be the same as
running a shell command on your machine from chat.

## Permission requests

Some agents ask before running a tool: Claude Code does for commands and file edits in its
default mode. By default (`permissions: auto`) the daemon approves every such request, so the
agent runs with full tool access and `access.allowFrom` is the only gate. Set `permissions: ask`
to be asked instead:

```yaml
agents:
  - id: cc
    harness: claude
    permissions: ask
```

- Each request appears in the chat as a message with the command and the agent's own options as
  buttons ("Allow", "Reject", …). Answer by tapping; a typed reply goes to the agent as your next
  message instead.
- Nobody answering within an hour declines the request. The agent is told nobody answered, not
  that you refused, and the turn continues. A reminder is posted after half an hour.
- `/stop` cancels a pending request together with the turn.
- Scheduled runs are always approved: nobody is there to answer.
- A platform without buttons (DingTalk, WeCom) cannot ask, so requests there are declined, again
  with the agent told why.
- Only agents that ask are affected. Codex (mode `agent`) and OpenCode ran a file-writing command
  without asking when measured; `agy` cannot be set to `ask`.

## Antigravity (`agy`)

`agy` is the only preset that does not speak ACP — it has no ACP mode — so it is
driven over its own documented
[headless stream-json protocol](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/headless/)
instead. Streaming, tool bubbles, multi-turn context, post-restart resume, skills,
`/model`, `/context` and `/usage` all work as they do on the ACP harnesses. What
differs is how the last three are obtained, because agy publishes each somewhere
other than its session:

- **Its own slash commands run as separate processes.** In stream-json mode a
  CLI-answered slash (`/model`, `/usage`, `/credits`, …) aborts the whole session,
  so the daemon answers those eleven names with a one-shot `agy -p=/<name>` and
  never forwards them. Everything else — above all your **skills** — reaches the
  session and expands normally.
- **Context usage comes from agy's stream, quota and the default model from its CLI.**
  On agy 1.4.7 and later each model step reports its token count, which the footer
  shows against the model's window. agy never says how big that window is, so the
  daemon knows it only for the models it was measured on (Gemini, Claude Sonnet/Opus
  4.6, GPT-OSS 120B); any other model shows no context numbers. The quota pools and,
  when no model is configured, agy's default model are fetched with `agy -p=/usage`
  and `agy -p=/model` alongside the turn — the quota at most once a minute, in whole
  percentages.
- **On an agy older than 1.4.7, all three come from its status line** instead: on
  startup the daemon backs `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` up once and
  points its `statusLine` at the daemon's own shim, which passes the numbers back
  over a pipe and still draws a status line for your terminal. agy 1.4.7 stopped
  running the status line in headless mode, but the daemon still installs the shim,
  for older versions and for your own interactive agy. Set
  `TALKCODE_NO_AGY_STATUSLINE=1` to leave the setting alone.
- **Skills** are read from `<cwd>/.agents/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`,
  `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills`, `~/.gemini/skills` and
  `~/.gemini/config/skills`, so `/skills` lists them and `/<name> <request>` runs one.
- **`/new` starts a new conversation**, as with every harness. Stopping a
  turn (`/stop`) restarts the child and resumes the same conversation, so context survives.
- **A message sent mid-turn waits for the turn to end**: agy's stream-json input runs
  each message as a turn of its own, with no way to join one already running.
- **A picture you send reaches it as a path.** The stream-json input carries text only, so
  where the ACP harnesses are shown the picture itself, agy is told where it was saved.

Any of the daemon's default flags can be overridden through `args` (they are
appended after the defaults, and agy's flag parsing is last-wins).

> [!NOTE]
> Google's FAQ states that accessing Antigravity with third-party tools violates
> its Terms of Service and may lead to account suspension. This harness only
> calls agy's own official headless interface and never handles your credentials
> (sign-in stays entirely inside `agy`), but the daemon is still a non-Google
> client driving your account — decide accordingly.
