# Scheduled tasks

English | [简体中文](zh-CN/scheduled-tasks.md)

Ask for it in plain words — *"every morning at 8, summarise the overnight CI failures"*,
*"in 30 minutes, run the backup and tell me how it went"* — and the agent registers a task the
gateway keeps. Tasks survive the agent's process being reclaimed and the daemon restarting,
which the harnesses' own schedulers do not.

| kind | what runs | where it answers |
|---|---|---|
| prompt, **fixed session** (default) | a turn in this conversation, by its agent — context accumulates, you can follow up in place | here, for **24 h** from registration; then it is marked expired |
| prompt, **new session** | a fresh session each run, by any agent | a new topic per run where the platform can open one (web UI, Telegram forums, Discord), else this chat; no time limit |
| **bash** | a command, run by the gateway itself — no agent | exit code, duration and the end of the output, long output attached |

Output can go to any chat the gateway has answered in, on any platform (`talkcode
channels` lists them). A run the gateway missed by less than an hour — it was restarting — is
made when it comes back; older is recorded as missed. Every change posts a card with the task's
details, written by the gateway rather than the agent, so what you read is what will run.

`/setting` has a **⏰ Scheduled tasks** button: every task with its next and last run, and
pause, resume and delete (delete asks twice). Where there are no buttons,
`/setting schedule [pause|resume|delete|run <id>]` does the same by typing.
