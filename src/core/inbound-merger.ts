/**
 * Inbound merger (one instance per session).
 *
 * - Coalesces rapid consecutive messages into one context turn instead of
 *   replying per message.
 * - A message that arrives while the agent is busy never cancels what it is doing. It is offered to
 *   the running turn first (`steer`), for a harness that can take input mid-turn; what the turn
 *   cannot take waits in a queue (keeps the latest batch, never drops) and starts as a fresh batch
 *   after the turn ends.
 * - `interrupt()` is the only way to cut a turn short: a user who typed `/stop` gets the turn
 *   cancelled and the backlog dropped.
 * - Lifecycle reactions: received 👀 / done ✅ / error ❌.
 *
 * ── Why a new message no longer interrupts ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Through 2.0.0 it did (`inbound.interruptOnNewMessage`, frozen on): every message sent mid-turn
 * cancelled the turn and restarted it with the new input. That made "also check the docs" cost a
 * half-finished test run, and a session query like `/usage` once cancelled a full suite mid-Bash
 * (see GenericCommand.query). The way a coding agent's own CLI handles the same thing is the model
 * here: Claude Code queues what is typed during a turn and hands it to the model at the next tool
 * boundary; codex calls the same thing steering. Probed 2026-10-10, with a message sent six seconds
 * into a thirty-second foreground command: claude (claude-agent-acp 0.81, Claude Code 2.1.296) and
 * codex (codex-acp 2.2.1, codex 0.160.1) both let the command finish and answered both requests in
 * one reply; opencode 2.0.26 rejects a second prompt outright over ACP, and agy 1.3.2 runs it as the
 * next turn. So "offer, else queue" is what every harness here supports, and `/stop` is the stop.
