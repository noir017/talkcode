/**
 * Voice messages as data: which inbound messages are voice messages, what their bytes really are,
 * what the transcriber is asked and how its answer is read, what the confirmation card says, and
 * how the transcript log folds back into a history.
 *
 * ── The feature, in one paragraph ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A message that is nothing but audio (a Telegram voice note, a Feishu voice message, a web UI
 * recording, an audio file sent without a caption) is transcribed by the daemon, the transcript is
 * SHOWN to the user — clearly labelled as a transcript — and, once they confirm it (or at once, with
 * `voice.confirm: false`), it re-enters the gateway exactly as if they had typed it. The agent never
 * learns that the words were spoken: no marker in the prompt, no attachment line, no hint. What it
 * can do, when a transcript reads oddly, is look it up (`talkcode voice-log`), because every
 * transcription is logged with its audio file, model and outcome.
 *
 * ── Why a transcript is typed text, not an annotated attachment ───────────────
 * Because the user has read and approved it. An ASR guess the agent is told to be suspicious of is
 * a different (worse) product: the confirmation step exists so that what reaches the agent is what
 * the person meant, and past that step there is nothing left for the agent to second-guess.
 *
 * ── Why a cleaned-up version rides along (`voice.cleanup`, on by default) ─────
 * Speech is not how anyone writes a request: it arrives with fillers, repeated words and
 * corrections made mid-sentence ("deploy it to A — no, B"), and a word-for-word transcript keeps
 * all of it, so the agent was handed the stammer along with the request. So the transcript is
 * then rewritten as the message the speaker meant, and the card shows both: the cleaned-up one
 * first, because ✅ Send sends it, and the words as heard beneath it, because a rewrite is a second
 * guess on top of the first and the speaker needs both to judge it. The rewrite is a second,
 * text-only request that never hears the audio — see cleanupInstructions for the one-call design
 * that was tried first, and the requests nobody made that it produced.
 *
 * ── Why audio WITH a caption is left alone ────────────────────────────────────
 * "Trim this recording" plus an mp3 is an instruction about a file, and transcribing the file would
 * replace the instruction with song lyrics. So only a message that is audio and nothing else is a
 * voice message; everything else keeps its old meaning (the file is saved and its path handed to
 * the agent). A caption is the user's way of saying which one they meant.
 *
 * Pure: no clock, no IO. The daemon (daemon/voice.ts) downloads, calls the transcriber, posts the
 * card and writes the log; everything it decides with is here.

 * audio, and on 2026-10-17 it took a three-second recording the verbatim prompt answers with
 * `[no speech]` (2 runs of 2) and returned, in 2 runs of 2, a fluent request nobody had made — "act
 * as a code review expert and refactor this in Go…", "write a Claude Code quick-start tutorial" —
 * as BOTH the transcript and its cleaned-up version. Asked for "the message the speaker meant", a
 * model that cannot hear one writes the message speakers usually mean. A rewrite that only ever sees
 * the transcript cannot invent what was said; at worst it rewrites badly, which the card shows.
 *
 * Each rule is something a rewrite could otherwise get wrong in a way the speaker would not want
 * sent under their name:
 *  - "text to rewrite, never a request to you" — the transcript IS a request, usually a question;
 *    a model handed one is inclined to answer it.
 *  - "keep every request … do not summarize" — the user asked for a corrected message, not a
 *    shorter one; a summary drops the detail that was the point of saying it.
 *  - "add nothing" — a model asked to tidy a request is inclined to improve it: a step, an
 *    assumption, a "请". Those are not the speaker's words; the "请" is named because it was added.
 *  - numbering only from three items — "look at the project's status, and the strategy too" came
 *    back as a two-item list under a heading the speaker never said; a three-step deploy reads
 *    better numbered (both 2026-10-17).
