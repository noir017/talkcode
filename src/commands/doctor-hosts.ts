 * That PATH is the host's login PATH (remote/shellenv.go) unless the agent's `env` sets PATH, in
 * which case it is exactly that value: remoteAgentEnv passes it through and talkcode-remote replaces
 * the login PATH with it (agentEnv in remote/daemon.go). Checking every agent against the login
 * PATH reported "not on the login PATH" for a command the agent's own PATH did reach, and failed
 * doctor on a host that worked (armbox, 2026-10-29: node and claude-agent-acp under ~/tc-e2e,
 * named only in the agent's env).
 *
 * Pure, so the script can be run against a local directory in a test.
