/**
 * Waiting out the work in progress before the gateway stops.
 *
 * A SIGTERM is how a container is stopped, and so how the gateway is restarted and updated
 * (docker/talkcode-host). Stopping at once cuts off every turn in progress — the agents on the hosts
 * go down with the gateway that started them (docs/remote-hosts.md) — so a SIGTERM that finds work
 * in progress waits for it first: the daemon stops taking new turns and new scheduled runs, lets the
 * running ones finish, and stops when none are left (Daemon.beginDrain). This file is the waiting.
 *
 * Bounded, because the turn being waited for can be an agent working for hours, and an update has
 * to land eventually. The bound is below CATCH_UP_GRACE_MS (core/schedule.ts, an hour) on purpose:
 * a scheduled run that falls due while the gateway waits is not started, and is caught up by the
 * next gateway only if it was missed by less than that.
