/**
 * The operator's agent hooks (`agents[].hooks` in config.yaml): commands the daemon runs at points in
 * an agent child's life that the harness itself cannot see. The harness has hooks of its own for
 * everything that happens inside a session — Claude Code's run under this gateway like anywhere
 * else — so only what lies outside one belongs here. Today that is `preLaunch`: before the child
 * exists, there is no harness to ask.
 *
 * ── Why preLaunch blocks ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It prepares the ground the agent stands on — a container started, a tunnel opened, a checkout
 * pulled — so an agent launched after a failed one would run on a half-prepared machine, which is
 * the one thing worse than not running. A failure therefore fails the startup, with the reason, and
 * the next message tries again from the top.
 *
 * ── What it gets ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `bash -lc`, through the same runner as a scheduled `--bash` task (schedule-bash.ts): its own
 * process group, killed whole on timeout. The working directory and environment are the ones the
 * agent is about to get, minus the reverse-command token — the hook runs before the session it
 * would belong to, so it has nothing to call back into (buildHarnessEnv's reasoning). Full output
 * goes to a log file per agent; the tail of it is what the chat sees on a failure.
 */

/**
 * How long a preLaunch hook may run. Generous next to the 30s the harness gets to answer
