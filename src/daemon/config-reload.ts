/**
 * Applying an edited config.yaml to the running daemon (`/reload`, `talkcode reload`) — the pure
 * half: what changed, which of it can take effect now, and the sentence that says so. The daemon
 * (Daemon.reloadConfig) reads the files and drives the side effects; the registry decides what
 * happens to the agent processes already running (ConversationRegistry.respawnAgents).
 *
 * ── Why in place ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every component was handed the same Config object at startup and reads it when it needs a value
 * (`/setting` has relied on that since it was written). So a reload copies the new sections INTO
 * that object rather than building a new daemon around a new one: nothing has to be re-wired, and
 * a turn already running keeps working on what it started with — an agent definition is captured
 * by its session when the session is created, which is why changed agents need respawnAgents.
 */

/**
 * How each section of config.yaml reaches a running daemon. A `satisfies Record` over the user
 * schema's keys, so a new section fails to compile until someone decides this for it.
 *
 * - live: read wherever it is used, so replacing it is the whole job.
 * - agents: replaced, and conversations running a changed agent are respawned onto it.
 * - restart: built into objects at startup — the platform adapters connect once, with these
 *   credentials — so a change is reported, not applied.
 * - ignore: carries nothing that can change at runtime.
