/**
 * The daemon running a scheduled `--bash` task: one `bash -lc`, its combined output captured twice —
 * a bounded tail in memory for the chat, and all of it in a log file beside the daemon's state.
 *
 * ── Why a process group ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `bash -lc 'a | b'` forks; killing bash alone on a timeout leaves `a` and `b` running, reparented to
 * init, holding whatever they held. So the child is started detached (its own group) and the whole
 * group is signalled — SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after KILL_GRACE_MS, the same escalation the agent
 * runtimes use for harness children.
 *
 * ── What the command gets ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The daemon's environment (or the caller's, when it passes one), minus the reverse-command token:
 * a bash task is not inside any conversation, and a token in the environment of something that
 * cannot use it is a secret spent for nothing (the same reasoning buildHarnessEnv records for agy's
 * one-shot CLI runs).
 *
 * Also the runner behind an agent's pre-launch hook (agent-hooks.ts), which is why the environment
 * and the moment of settling are options rather than fixed.
