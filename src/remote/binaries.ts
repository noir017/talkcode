 * and with no `@cert-authority` line to verify it the client compares the certificate's own key —
 * which need not be the host key at all. A Teleport agentless node is exactly that: its sshd
 * carries a second ed25519 key with a Teleport-signed certificate (`HostCertificate`), so the key
 * `ssh-keyscan` returns and docs/remote-hosts.md tells the operator to compare is not the one
 * presented, and every connection failed "Host key verification failed" (armbox, 2026-10-29).
