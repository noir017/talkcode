/**
 * Reading a file the agent sent on the page itself, instead of downloading it first.
 *
 * A report, a plan or a log the agent wrote is something to be read, and every other way of
 * reading one here went through the downloads folder and another application — on a phone, an
 * application that may not exist. So the page asks `server.ts` `view` for the file, and gets back
 * HTML this module built from its bytes, which it shows over the transcript.
 *
 * ── Never the file as itself ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The download rule (`server.ts` `download`) is that nothing the agent sent is served as its own
 * type, because an `.html` or an `.svg` rendered on this origin would hold the session's cookie.
 * This does not bend that rule; it goes round it. The browser never receives the file — it
 * receives what `web-markdown.ts` (the XSS boundary, which escapes every character before it
 * builds a tag) made of it, or the file's text escaped whole inside a `<pre>`. That is the same
 * trust the page already extends to every message the agent streams, so an `.html` is on the list
 * below as source to be read, and is not, and cannot be, rendered.
 *
 * Deliberately absent: PDF and office documents. Their text is not in their bytes, so showing one
 * means a renderer — the browser's own PDF viewer, which a `sandbox` CSP turns off and which the
 * download rule exists to keep off this origin, or a library of several megabytes. Neither was
 * worth it for the first version; they stay downloads.
