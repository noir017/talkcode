/**
 * The web app manifest and the app icon, so a phone can install the web UI to its home screen.
 *
 * ── Why this lives in a .ts file as strings and base64 ────────────────────────
 * Same reason `page.ts` does: there is no asset-copy step anywhere in the build, and
 * `package.json`'s `files` ships only `dist` and `skill`. An `icon.png` beside the source
 * would typecheck, pass tests, and 404 in the published package. Anything the daemon serves
 * has to survive `tsc`, which means it has to be a module.
 *
 * ── What is actually required ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Less than most guides claim. Chrome dropped the service-worker-with-a-fetch-handler
 * requirement — the check was a proxy for "has an offline story" and sites defeated it with
 * empty handlers, so it was removed rather than tightened
 * (https://developer.chrome.com/blog/update-install-criteria, read 2026-09-20). What remains
 * is HTTPS and a manifest. So there is no service worker here, and there should not be one
 * added for installability alone: it would also mean caching the app shell, and the shell is
 * deliberately served `no-store` because a stale copy after an upgrade is a support question.
 */

/**
 * The icon, as the vector it was drawn as: a `>_` prompt, which is what is on the other end.
 *
 * No `width`/`height` — the manifest entry declares `sizes: "any"` and the consumer rasterises
 * at whatever size it needs. Chromium parses this entry without complaint (verified against
 * `Page.getAppManifest`, Chromium 1148), and Firefox takes SVG icons too.
 *
 * The glyph sits inside the middle 60% of the canvas rather than filling it, because the entry
 * is also declared `maskable`: Android crops the icon to whatever shape the launcher uses, and
 * only a circle of 80% diameter is guaranteed to survive. A glyph drawn to the edges loses its
 * ends on a round launcher.

 * The same icon rasterised to 192x192, because two consumers will not take the SVG.
 *
 * iOS has no manifest-icon support worth relying on and reads `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">`,

 * back to a generated letter tile rather than to nothing, which looks like a bug. 1604 bytes
 * is a cheap way to not have to know which builds those are.
