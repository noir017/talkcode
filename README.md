**Your coding agent, in every chat app.**

A gateway daemon that connects chat platforms to your coding agent — Claude Code,
Codex, OpenCode (via the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com)),
or Google's Antigravity CLI. Message the bot; the agent runs on your machine and
streams its answer into a single, live-edited message.

Forked from [l0ng-ai/agent-anywhere](https://github.com/l0ng-ai/agent-anywhere); this project
was called `agent-anywhere` until 2.0.0.

## Features

- **Eight platforms, one daemon** — Discord, Telegram, Slack, Lark, QQ, LINE, WeCom, DingTalk; multi-account. [→](docs/platforms.md)
- **Or no platform at all** — the [web UI](docs/web-ui.md) above, behind one shared token or your SSO, with an optional terminal.
- **Any ACP agent, plus agy** — Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Antigravity, or `custom`; routed by platform, channel, user or command. [→](docs/agents.md)
- **Native streaming** — in-place edits, live tool-call bubbles, lifecycle reactions.
- **Send while it works** — a message sent mid-turn joins the running turn instead of stopping it, as typing into Claude Code's own CLI does; `/stop` stops. [→](docs/chat-commands.md#sending-while-the-agent-works)
- **Attachments** — images and files you send are downloaded and handed to the agent.
- **Topics are conversations** — a Telegram or Feishu topic, a Slack or Discord thread, each with its own agent, its own [directory](docs/working-directory.md) and an [automatic name](docs/topic-names.md).
- **Persistent** — conversations survive restarts; `/new`, `/stop`, `/kill`; idle agents are released and resumed on the next message. [→](docs/chat-commands.md)
- **The agent acts in the chat** — sends files, asks with buttons, replies, reacts, reads history. [→](docs/agent-actions.md)
- **Scheduled tasks** — "every morning at 8, …" becomes a task the gateway keeps, surviving restarts. [→](docs/scheduled-tasks.md)
- **Voice messages** — transcribed, shown to you, and sent on once you confirm. [→](docs/voice.md)
- **Small config** — five sections, `${VAR}` and `.env` expansion; [`/setting`](docs/settings.md) edits the fields worth changing from chat.

## Quick start

talkcode is not on npm. Install the tarball attached to the
[latest release](https://github.com/noir017/talkcode/releases/latest), with `X.Y.Z` its version:

```bash
npm install -g https://github.com/noir017/talkcode/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/talkcode-X.Y.Z.tgz

talkcode setup    # wizard: platform, credentials, agent
talkcode doctor   # self-check
talkcode start    # message your bot
```

`harness: claude` reuses this machine's `claude /login` session — no API key
needed for personal use.

<details>
<summary><strong>Or let your agent set it up</strong></summary>

Paste into Claude Code (or any coding agent):

```text
Set up https://github.com/noir017/talkcode for me: install the CLI
from the latest GitHub release's talkcode-X.Y.Z.tgz (npm i -g <its URL>;
it is not on npm), then follow the skill bundled in the installed
package (skill/SKILL.md, under `npm root -g`/talkcode) to configure
and start it.
```

</details>

The smallest useful `~/.config/talkcode/config.yaml` is the web UI and one agent:

```yaml
version: 1
platforms:
  web:
    type: webui
    token: ${WEB_TOKEN}       # the password the page asks for; ${VAR} also reads <configDir>/.env
agents:
  - id: claude
    harness: claude
    cwd: ~/projects
routing:
  default: claude
access:
  allowFrom: ["web:owner"]
```

Then open `http://<host>:8787`. Everything else — more platforms, several agents, routing —
is in [Configuration](docs/configuration.md).

> [!WARNING]
> Agents run with full tool access. An empty `access.allowFrom` lets anyone
> who can message the bot run commands on your machine — fill it in any
> shared deployment. The web UI speaks plain HTTP on every interface by default;
> read [Exposing it](docs/web-ui.md#exposing-it) before it leaves a network you control.

[MIT](LICENSE)

This project began as a fork of [l0ng-ai/agent-anywhere](https://github.com/l0ng-ai/agent-anywhere)
at `3d855f8`, and the original architecture — the platform profile seam in particular — is still
recognisable underneath. It has grown a long way past that point since. The upstream MIT copyright
notice is retained in [LICENSE](LICENSE), which covers both codebases.
